JDBC (along with optional extensions)
Mainly interfaces

Different vendors provide different implementations (e.g., OracleConnection, SybaseConnection, etc.)

Almost all methods throw SQLException (all that directly concern us do)

Many interfaces have a close() method to conserve resources

For any interface that can be closed, most of its methods throw a SQLException after the interface has been closed (except for, e.g., isClosed() & close())
